## Performance Test Sub-process

### Test sub-process objective

To provide information concerning the fulfilment of performance requirements for the system.

### Planned testing sub-process content

#### Static test 1: Performance requirements documentation

**Test objective**

To provide information about the quality of the performance requirements

**Test item**

The set of performance requirements

**Test basis**

Internal and/or external checklists for documentation of performance requirements, for example regarding testability. 

**Test design techniques\(s\):**

Technical review or inspection \(remember that an inspection should be preceded by an informal or technical review to ensure a certain maturity of the requirements to be inspected\).

#### Static test 2: Performance requirements completeness

**Test objective**

To provide information about the completeness of the performance requirements \(all functional requirements should have associated performance requirement\(s\)\)

**Test item**

All requirements

**Test basis**

Vertical traceability information between functional requirements and performance requirements

**Test design techniques\(s\):**

Technical review

#### Static test 3: Architectural design with regard to performance

**Test objective**

To provide information about how the performance requirements have been incorporated in the architectural design

**Test item**

Architectural design

**Test basis**

Performance requirements and relevant checklists

#### **Test design techniques\(s\):**

Walkthrough, technical review, or inspection \(remember that an inspection should be preceded by an  informal or technical review to ensure a certain maturity of the requirements to be inspected\).

#### Static test 4: Detailed design with regard to performance

**Test objective**

To provide information about how the performance requirements have been incorporated in the detailed design

**Test item**

One or more detailed design items as appropriate

**Test basis**

Performance requirements and relevant checklists

#### **Test design techniques\(s\):**

Walkthrough, technical review, or inspection \(remember that an inspection should be preceded by an informal or technical review to ensure a certain maturity of the requirements to be inspected\).

#### Dynamic test 1: Applicable sub-system with regard to performance

**Test objective**

To provide information about the performance of a specific sub-system

**Test item**

One or more relevant sub-systems

**Test basis**

Performance requirements and possibly identified performance risks

#### Detailed test processes**\(s\):**

Test design and implementation; test environment set-up and maintenance; test execution; and test incident reporting. Some test procedures for integration testing may be reused

**Test design techniques\(s\):**
